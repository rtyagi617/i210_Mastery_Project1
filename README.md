# i210_Mastery_Project1
You are running an online video channel. Your subscribers pay to watch videos on your channel of different lengths. You also have a competing channel - will your subscribers spend more time watching your videos than your competitor's? Who will be more successful?

There are 4 parts to Mastery Project 1:

# 1. Enter the titles for the videos in your channel
Assume your channel is empty. Write code to allow the user to enter the titles of the
videos to be added to the channel. The user should be able to add as many as they
want to. Then print the titles in the channel so that you can see all of them at once.

# 2. Set a length for your videos, and run some computations
For each video, ask the user to give you a length in minutes for that video. Videos are
measured in minutes, and these can have decimal components (like 3.5 minutes). Once
the user has entered a length for each video, compute and show them the length of
the shortest video, the length of the longest video, and the average video length.
Your channel is very particular, so you want the average length to be displayed with
exactly 3 decimal points of precision.

# 3. Bring in your subscribers
In this part of the project, you’ll compute how much time your subscribers spent
watching your videos. Ask the user to tell you how many subscribers your channel
has. For each subscriber, randomly choose one of the videos in your channel (it’s ok
to choose the same video multiple times) to have them watch. Show the total amount
of time spent between all the videos that all subscribers watched, as well as which
videos were watched by your subscribers (don’t show duplicated here!).

# 4. Compare your channel to your competitor
Assume your competitor has a random amount of subscribers (between 1 and 100).
Compute the amount of subscribers for your competitor (since it’s random, this
should vary each time!). Each of their subscribers watches 1 video on their channel
that is between 1 and 5 minutes long (choose this randomly per subscriber!).
Compute the total amount of minutes your competitor’s subscribers spent watching
their channel. Finally, figure out which channel had more watch time! Output whether
it was your channel, their channel, or a tie! To make sure that you’re correct, output
the total time watched for each channel.
